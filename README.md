# The Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Lexical Diversity (TAALED) 1.3.1
This tool was developed by Kristopher Kyle in collaboration with Scott Crossley and Scott Jarvis
See https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taaled.html for more information.

# Quick Start Guide
For Mac OSX, download the TAALED_1_3_1_Mac.zip file (found under the "releases" tab). After extracting the TAALED program from the .zip file, double-click the icon to open the program. Note that you may have to change your security preferences to open TAALED.
For Windows 7, 8, and 10 (64-bit versions only), download the TAALED_1_3_1_win.zip file (found under the "releases" tab). After extracting the TAALED program from the .zip file, double-click the icon to open the program.
Note that after clicking on the TAALED icon, a terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) window will open. TAALED will take 10-20 seconds to initialize, depending on the speed of your program.

The source code for TAALED 1.3.1 is also available. For TAALED to work properly the user must have spaCy installed (see https://spacy.io/usage/ for instructions).

After downloading and extracting the TAALED_1_3_1_Py3.zip file, the user can start the program using the following command:
    python TAALED_1_3_1.py

Also note that the underlying functions for calculating lexical diversity are distributed as the Python package "lexical-diversity". See https://github.com/kristopherkyle/lexical_diversity for more information.
